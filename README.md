# Carbon footprint of the Levenshtein distance algorithm

## Purpose and algorithm

This algorithm, implemented in multiple languages, calculate the Levenshtein distance between two words.

The algorithm :
* reads the file `dictionary.txt`, containing more than 20000 words from an english dictionary
