# Carbon footprint of the Levenshtein distance algorithm

## Purpose and algorithm

The goal of this project is to compare carbon footprints of multiple languages through programs that execute the same task.

This algorithm, implemented in multiple languages, reads a dictionary of words in a text file, and calculates the Levenshtein distance between all consecutive words. This computation is done in two ways : recursively, and iteratively (using dynamic programming).

Every program takes one argument, which is a file path of a dictionary containing one word per line.
* reads a file containing one word per line
* for every pair of consecutive words, calculates the Levenshtein distance recursively and iteratively
